# Game(Name undecided yet)
## Why I made this project
- This is a game I used to play when I was in my Primary school. I modified it a little bit. I cannot really remember all the details. So I added some.
- I have learned, and I am about to learn some Machine Learning algorithm. Instead of just practicing it in the Homework Proferssor gave. I would like to try those in real game to see is that better than the one I come up with without any learning.
- I hope I can design a game for myself. I want to be a Game Designer. 
## How to play this
Currently, the game is not playable online yet. There is two TODOs for this:
- Change the coding inline String to enums and provide English version of interface
- Put this into a website.
- Add more kind of players.
